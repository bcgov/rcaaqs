#' Compute specific CAAQS metrics
#' 
#' Compute specific CAAQS metrics for different forms of air pollution.
#'
#' @param data Data frame. Hourly raw pollution data with at least date-time and
#'   value columns
#' @param dt Character. The name of the date-time column. Default `"date"`
#' @param val Character. The name of the value column. Default `"value"`
#' @param by Character vector. Grouping variables in data, probably an id if 
#'   using multiple sites. Even if not using multiple sites, you should specify 
#'   the id column so that it is retained in the output.
#' @param exclude_df Data frame. The dates over which data should be excluded 
#'   (see details). Data should be arranged either with one column of dates to 
#'   omit, or two columns specifying a series of start and end date ranges to 
#'   omit.
#' @param exclude_df_dt Character vector. The names of the date columns in 
#'   `exclude_df`. Must specify either one (a series of dates), or two (the
#'   start and end columns specifying dates ranges).
#' @param quiet Logical. Suppress progress messages (default FALSE)
#'   
#' @details To omit days which are suspected to be influenced by Transboundary
#'   Flows or Exceptional Events create a data frame that either a) contains a
#'   column listing all the days which are to be omitted, or b) contains two
#'   columns listing the start and end dates of all the date periods which are
#'   to be omitted. This is supplied as `exclude_df`. Use
#'   `exlcude_df_dt` to specify the name of the column containing the
#'   dates, or the names of the columns containing the start and end of the date
#'   ranges (see examples and vignette for more details).
#'   
#' @return `caaqs` object with results of the caaqs analysis, including results 
#' from intermediate steps. The final `caaqs` results can be extracted with the 
#' [get_caaqs()] function and contains the following columns:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item caaqs_year The year corresponding to the CAAQS metric
#'     \item metric The type of CAAQS metric calculated
#'     \item metric_value The CAAQS metric value, rounded to appropriate digits
#'     \item caaqs The CAAQS status, Achieved, Not Achieved, or Insufficient Data
#'     \item mgmt The management status actions
#'     \item excluded Logical value indicating whether any of the underlying
#'     data was excluded due to transboundary flows or exceptional events
#'     \item flag_daily_incomplete Logical value indicating whether any of the
#'     daily data was flagged as incomplete (see CAAQS guidelines for more
#'     details). If NA, indicates that this particular metric is never flagged.
#'     \item flag_yearly_incomplete Logical value indicating whether any of the
#'     yearly data was flagged as incomplete (see CAAQS guidelines for more
#'     details). If NA, indicates that this particular metric is never flagged.}
#'  
#'  To obtain any of the intermediate results data frames, use the 
#'  `get_*` family of functions. See `?get_caaqs
