}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame. Hourly raw pollution data with at least date-time and
value columns}

\item{dt}{Character. The name of the date-time column. Default \code{"date"}}

\item{val}{Character. The name of the value column. Default \code{"value"}}

\item{by}{Character vector. Grouping variables in data, probably an id if
using multiple sites. Even if not using multiple sites, you should specify
the id column so that it is retained in the output.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress progress messages (default FALSE)}

\item{exclude_df}{Data frame. The dates over which data should be excluded
(see details). Data should be arranged either with one column of dates to
omit, or two columns specifying a series of start and end date ranges to
omit.}

\item{exclude_df_dt}{Character vector. The names of the date columns in
\code{exclude_df}. Must specify either one (a series of dates), or two (the
start and end columns specifying dates ranges).}
}
\value{
\code{caaqs} object with results of the caaqs analysis, including results
from intermediate steps. The final \code{caaqs} results can be extracted with the
\code{\link[=get_caaqs]{get_caaqs()}} function and contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item caaqs_year The year corresponding to the CAAQS metric
\item metric The type of CAAQS metric calculated
\item metric_value The CAAQS metric value, rounded to appropriate digits
\item caaqs The CAAQS status, Achieved, Not Achieved, or Insufficient Data
\item mgmt The management status actions
\item excluded Logical value indicating whether any of the underlying
data was excluded due to transboundary flows or exceptional events
\item flag_daily_incomplete Logical value indicating whether any of the
daily data was flagged as incomplete (see CAAQS guidelines for more
details). If NA, indicates that this particular metric is never flagged.
\item flag_yearly_incomplete Logical value indicating whether any of the
yearly data was flagged as incomplete (see CAAQS guidelines for more
details). If NA, indicates that this particular metric is never flagged.}

To obtain any of the intermediate results data frames, use the
\verb{get_*} family of functions. See `?get_caaqs
}
\description{
Compute specific CAAQS metrics for different forms of air pollution.
}
\details{
To omit days which are suspected to be influenced by Transboundary
Flows or Exceptional Events create a data frame that either a) contains a
column listing all the days which are to be omitted, or b) contains two
columns listing the start and end dates of all the date periods which are
to be omitted. This is supplied as \code{exclude_df}. Use
\code{exlcude_df_dt} to specify the name of the column containing the
dates, or the names of the columns containing the start and end of the date
ranges (see examples and vignette for more details).
