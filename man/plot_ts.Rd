\title{Plot daily time series data with exceedances and optionally caaqs for a
particular station}
\usage{
plot_ts(
  x,
  id = NULL,
  id_col = NULL,
  rep_yr,
  plot_caaqs = TRUE,
  plot_exceedances = FALSE,
  base_size = 10,
  annot_size = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{caaqs}}

\item{id}{the id of the station you would like to plot}

\item{id_col}{the column in which to look for \code{id}}

\item{rep_yr}{The reporting year}

\item{plot_caaqs}{Should the caaqs be plotted?}

\item{plot_exceedances}{logical. Should exceedances be plotted?}

\item{base_size}{base font size for the plot}

\item{annot_size}{size of annotations. Scaling of this size is not the same
as the rest of the font sizes, so you will have to experiment. Defaults to
0.32*base_size}
}
\value{
a ggplot2 object
