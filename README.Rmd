## Overview

An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to facilitate the calculation of air quality 
metrics according to the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards
([CAAQS](http://www.ccme.ca/en/current_priorities/air/caaqs.html))

## Features

- General functions for doing things like formatting dates, filling in
  sequences, etc. 
- Functions for stepwise calculation of CAAQS metrics&mdash;including implementing data completeness criteria&mdash;for
  different air pollutants. Currently these are complete for PM~2.5~ 
  (annual and 24hr), O~3~, NO~2~, and SO~2~ metrics. 
- Functions for assigning
  metrics for different pollutants into achievement and management categories.

## Installation

The package is not available on CRAN, but can be installed using
the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed

library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/rcaaqs")

```

## Usage

This is a simple example using the included sample data set for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. 

```{r}
library(rcaaqs)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

# Look at the sample data:
glimpse(pm25_sample_data)

# Compute the PM2.5 Annual CAAQS
pm_annual <- pm_annual_caaqs(pm25_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(pm_annual)

# Compute the PM2.5 24hr CAAQS
pm_24h <- pm_24h_caaqs(pm25_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(pm_24h)
```

This is a simple example using the included sample data set for O<sub>3</sub>. 
```{r}
# Look at the sample data:
glimpse(o3_sample_data)

# Compute the Ozone CAAQS
o3 <- o3_caaqs(o3_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(o3)
```

This is a simple example using the included sample data set for SO<sub>2</sub>. 

```{r}
# Look at the sample data:
glimpse(so2_sample_data)

# Compute the SO2 1-hr CAAQS (3-yr rolling average of 1hr measures)
so2_3yr <- so2_3yr_caaqs(so2_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(so2_3yr)

# Compute the SO2 annual CAAQS (1-yr average across all hourly measures)
so2_1yr <- so2_1yr_caaqs(so2_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(so2_1yr)
```

This is a simple example using the included sample data set for NO<sub>2</sub>. 
```{r}
# Look at the sample data:
glimpse(no2_sample_data)

# Compute the NO2 1-hr CAAQS (3-yr rolling average of 1hr measures)
no2_3yr <- no2_3yr_caaqs(no2_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(no2_3yr)

# Compute the NO2 annual CAAQS (1-yr average across all hourly measures)
no2_1yr <- no2_1yr_caaqs(no2_sample_data, by = c("ems_id", "site"))
glimpse(no2_1yr)
```


You can view the CAAQS Achievement Levels as well as Management Levels in the included data frames. These are used internally in `rcaaqs` CAAQS functions to assign metric values at each station to the appropriate CAAQS Achievement Level and Management Level:

```{r}
achievement_levels

management_levels
```


## Project Status

The package is under active development.
